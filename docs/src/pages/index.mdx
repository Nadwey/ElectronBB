:::caution

From Electron 20 and on, you will have to disable sandboxing of the renderer process, due to [Planned Breaking API Changes (20.0)](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/breaking-changes#planned-breaking-api-changes-200)

## Installation

```bash
npm i electronbb
```

## Usage

See [Intro](docs/Intro)

You can also [view it on GitHub](https://github.com/Nadwey/ElectronBB/tree/main/docs/docs/Intro.md), but it's ugly

## Building the documentation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nadwey/ElectronBB.git
cd ElectronBB/docs
npm i
npm run build
```

## ⚠️VERY-ALPHA

This library is currently in very-alpha state, so I don't recommend using it in your app, especially in production.
